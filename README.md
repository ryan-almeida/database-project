# Build a Bookstore Application with AWS Databases
## Create a demo bookstore web application and learn to use various purpose-built AWS Databases such as DynamoDB, ElasticSeach Service, Elasticache for Redis and Neptune 



### This project is an example built alongside an AWS Tutorial (https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/database/building-a-modern-application-with-purpose-built-aws-databases/) that allows you to build web storefornt, (a bookstore in this example) which is created on top of multiple databases, each addressing a different use case. 

### This is a great project to familiarize yourself with various database technologies offered within the AWS ecosystem, as well as using serverless and web deployment services in AWS, such as Lambda, API Gateway, and Cognito.
