# Build a Bookstore Application with AWS Databases
## Create a demo bookstore web application and learn to use various purpose-built AWS Databases such as DynamoDB, ElasticSeach Service, Elasticache for Redis and Neptune 


This project is an example built alongside an AWS Tutorial (https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/database/building-a-modern-application-with-purpose-built-aws-databases/) that allows you to build web storefornt, (a bookstore in this example) which is created on top of multiple databases, each addressing a different use case. 

This is a great project to familiarize yourself with various database technologies offered within the AWS ecosystem, as well as using serverless and web deployment services in AWS, such as Lambda, API Gateway, and Cognito. You get to:

- Leverage DynamoDB as the durable system of record for the product catalog and learn the principles of NoSQL database design, scalability, and high availability.
- Integrate Amazon Elasticsearch to enhance search functionality, teaching you how to index and query data efficiently
- Use DynamoDB Streams with AWS Lambda for asynchronous updates to the Elasticsearch index and learn event-driven architecture and serverless computing concepts
- Implement Elasticache for Redis to manage a best sellers list to learn in-memory data storage techniques and performance optimization.
- Employing Amazon Neptune for social recommendations to gain insights into graph databases and personalized content delivery.
- Utilizing API Gateway and Lambda to handle various API calls highlights RESTful API design and serverless application development
